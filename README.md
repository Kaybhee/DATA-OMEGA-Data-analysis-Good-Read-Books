The attributes that set j.k.Rowling/Mary Grand PraÃ© from her peers is the ability to tell a story I'm the most compelling manner with a reasonable plot, superb characterisation and an incentive imagination.

The aforementioned attributes are what defines a great author but not a great book overtime, Having read and saw the reviews  on the classic  "Harry Potter" , her work were mostly about light-hearted children books which allowed her work to avoid much scrutiny from literature critics and this worked in favour of other authors with several books published.
